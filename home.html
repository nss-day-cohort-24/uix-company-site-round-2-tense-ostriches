                <p>We believe in the dignity and worth of each individual resident, regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.
                    We believe that every resident has the right to retain and enhance their personal identity. We believe that every resident
                    should be encouraged to retain or regain the highest level of independence possible. We believe that the medical, nursing,
                    personal, social, physical, psychological, and spiritual needs of each resident should be fulfilled. We believe that each
                    resident has the right to participate in the decision-making process regarding their care, and we embrace and pledge to implement
                    the statement of Residents' Rights which is incorporated into the policies of St. Paul's Senior Community.</p>
